On localhost editing, `.php` files have the following differences in configuring.
> Below is the **Infinity Free** config:<br>
>>$servername = "sql300.infinityfree.com";<br>
>>$dbusername = "if0_40265318";<br>
>>$dbpassword = "admin040920";<br>
>>$dbname = "if0_40265318_root";<br>

<br>

>And **localhost** config:<br>
>>$servername = "localhost";<br>
>>$dbusername = "root";<br>
>>$dbpassword = "admin";<br>
>>$dbname = "sys";<br>

<br>

**❗❗❗ REMEMBER TO CHANGE THESE WHEN UPLOADING `.php` FILES.**<br>
Else, there will be problem linking the database.
